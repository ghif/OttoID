These codes contain the very first attempt of using Logistic Regression with Theano.

- main_otto.py: Main program
- LogisticRegression.py: the Class of Logistic Regression implementation.
- loader.py: everything related to the data (load, save, preprocessing). so the name 'loader' is actually misleading, sorry.

To run this code, put the "train.csv" and "test.csv" in the same path.

If you want to try another algorithm, I recommend to add another class file (something like LogisticRegression.py) and call it from main_otto.py.
